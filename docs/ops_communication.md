That trace starts with...

```
67A: 12 82			
6DA: 42 82 03 00 0A 00 03 00			
67A: 12 81
```
....which was missing from the earlier ones.

Which roughly translate as...
RNS-E -> OPS: Are you there?
OPS -> RNS-E: Yes + some fixed version/identification data
RNS-E -> OPS: OK, received. I'm good with that. Go ahead...
